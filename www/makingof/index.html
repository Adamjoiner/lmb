							<p class="standfirst">On September 19 and 20, twelve web developers, designers, writers, standardistas, and technologists descended upon CERN on the border of Switzerland to rebuild the line-mode browser. This is their story.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="d2">
						<p>This is our post-mortum on the project — what did we learn, what did we hack, what did we drink, what did we use to build this thing. </p>

						<h3>What tech did we use?</h3>

						<p>The approach we took eventually was to use a proxy node server, that allowed us to request arbitrary web resources (we’d run into CORS problems with many sites). In the node app, we manipulate the DOM, disabling scripts and style (linked, embedded and inline), but, importantly, leaving the script, link and style elements in place, because the original line mode browser would display their contents (its parsing rule was to strip the start and end tags off unknown elements, but display their content inline, so it would display the content of style, link and script elements, but would not be affected by them, which is why we disabled them).</p>
						
						<p>After the DOM was changed like this, we add the CSS and JavaScript for the emulation, then serialise the document back into a string, and then send this to the browser.</p>

						<p>The browser then parses the document, applies the CSS and runs the JavaScript, so you the user can experience the awesomeness that was the line mode browser.</p>

						<p>The CSS was used for 99% of the appearance of the document, with JavaScript used for some positional aspects for example the command line that is fixed at the bottom of the content. This would be possible with CSS, but the required features, including viewport units aren’t supported across all widely used browsers.</p>

						<h3>What hacks did we use?</h3>
						<p>Hacks! We do not hack. OK, we did some hacky things, but all in all nothing particularly grubby.</p>
						<p>As mentioned, we used some JavaScript for calculating some aspects of the page layout, due to the lack of widespread support for features we’d otherwise use in CSS to do this instead of JavaScript.  </p>

						<h3>Will what we built today be usable in 10 years? </h3>
						<p>We hope so! One of the things we wanted to do is emulate how the LMB would handle today’s web content, and while the average 1.2MB of content today’s web page would more than swamp the memory available to these early browser.</p>
						<p>But I think that what we built this with, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, will be around for many more than 10 years. At least we hope so!</p>
